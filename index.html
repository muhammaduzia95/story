  <p>First of all, I am really grateful that I found the University of the People (UoPeople) platform. It feels like a light at the end of a long tunnel, giving me hope to pursue my passion for computer science despite many challenges. My name is Muhammad Usama Zia, and I am from Lahore, Pakistan. Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by computers. I wanted to learn more about them and work with them. So here is how my life goes around Computer Science. </p>

<p>When I was in high school, I wanted to study computer science, but in my country, parents often make decisions about their children's education. My father chose for me to study Biology, Physics, Maths, and Chemistry in FSc, which is equivalent to 12 years of education. I was not happy because of the decision. I thought I might get a chance to study computer science at university, but in 2016, my father decided I should join the College for Business Administration at the University of the Punjab. I appreciated their support, but I felt frustrated because this was not what I wanted.</p>

<p>My classes started in 2016, and at that time, my father was supporting my education and other expenses. However, my academic journey took a turn for the worse in my third semester when I had a serious road accident and broke my leg. I had to stay in bed for a long time, which forced me to stop my Business Administration studies. This period of physical and emotional recovery was incredibly challenging. As time passed, continuing my education seemed increasingly unattainable, especially when my father stopped supporting me financially.</p>

<p>Despite these difficulties, I never lost my passion for computers. In 2020, I enrolled in a free short course on WordPress web development. This was the start of my self-learning journey in computer science. I used every free resource I could find to teach myself web development. It was not easy, but I enjoyed every bit of it. I also got financial aid to complete the Meta Front End Web Development course on Coursera, which helped me learn even more.</p>

<p>In 2022, I started working on local WordPress projects with a friend, earning some pocket money. But by the end of 2023, I realized that working with WordPress alone would not help me grow or fully satisfy my interest in computer science. Clients were not paying well, and the growth opportunities were limited. I knew I wanted to learn more about coding, programming, and creating complex applications.</p>

<p>Determined to gain practical experience, I decided to approach local software houses and offer to work for free. Unfortunately, without a formal degree in computer science, I was repeatedly turned away. I spoke to many friends already working in the field, hoping for a breakthrough, but the lack of formal education remained a significant barrier. This experience solidified my decision to return to college, this time with a clear focus on computer science. However, the financial constraints were still a major hurdle.</p>

<p>Then, I found out about the University of the People on YouTube. The idea of a tuition-free, accredited online university seemed like a perfect solution. It would allow me to study computer science without the heavy financial burden. The flexibility of the program would also let me continue working on freelance projects to support myself while studying. Discovering UoPeople gave me hope, and I am now applying for a scholarship to pursue my dreams.</p>

<p>Applying to UoPeople represents a critical step in my journey. Even the $60 application fee was a challenge for me, and I had to borrow it from someone. This illustrates the financial difficulties I face and underscores my determination to pursue this opportunity despite the obstacles. I am confident that with the support of a scholarship, I can finally achieve my dream of earning a degree in computer science, gaining the skills and credentials needed to succeed in the industry.</p>

<p>Since I could not complete my Business Administration degree due to the accident, my journey has been marked by resilience, self-motivation, and a relentless pursuit of my passion. I believe I deserve this scholarship because I am committed to making the most of this opportunity, not only to transform my own life but also to contribute positively to the field of computer science. I have taken every possible step to educate myself and gain relevant experience in web development. For instance, after my recovery, I took several online courses, including a comprehensive Meta Front End Web Development course on Coursera, which I was able to take thanks to financial aid. These courses have equipped me with foundational knowledge and practical skills in web development, but I realize that a formal degree is essential to deepen my expertise and open up more significant opportunities.</p>

<p>In 2022, I partnered with a friend to take on local WordPress projects. These projects provided me with some income and practical experience, but they also highlighted the limitations of working solely with WordPress. Clients in this field often do not pay well, and the projects tend to be repetitive with limited scope for innovation and growth. By the end of 2023, I found myself yearning for more challenging and rewarding work. I wanted to dive deeper into coding, to learn programming languages, and to create more complex and functional applications.</p>

<p>Realizing the need for more formal education, I approached local software houses, offering to work for free to gain experience. However, without a computer science degree or relevant credentials, I was turned away repeatedly. I sought help from friends already established in the software industry, but the lack of a formal education remained a significant hurdle. These experiences made me even more determined to pursue a degree in computer science.</p>

<p>Applying to UoPeople is a crucial step towards achieving my dreams. Even the $60 application fee was a significant challenge for me, which I had to borrow from someone. This situation underscores the financial difficulties I face and my determination to overcome them. With a scholarship, I can finally pursue a computer science degree, gain the necessary skills, and earn the credentials required to succeed in the technology industry.</p>

<p>My journey has been one of resilience and self-motivation. Despite numerous setbacks, I have continued to pursue my passion for computer science. I believe I deserve this scholarship because I am committed to making the most of this opportunity. I am eager to transform my life and contribute positively to the field of computer science. I am ready to put in the hard work and dedication needed to excel in my studies and future career.</p>

<p>In short, my journey from being a child fascinated by computers to an aspiring computer scientist has been filled with challenges and setbacks. Despite these obstacles, I have never given up on my dream. The University of the People offers me a chance to finally achieve my goal of earning a degree in computer science. I am confident that with the support of a scholarship, I can overcome the financial barriers that have held me back and make significant contributions to the field of computer science. Thank you for considering my application. I am willing to provide any additional information or documentation to support my story and demonstrate my commitment to this journey.</p>

<p>Financial constraints have been a constant barrier in my educational journey. My father's withdrawal of financial support after my accident further complicated my situation. Despite these challenges, I have remained steadfast in my pursuit of knowledge and skills in computer science. This is why discovering the University of the People felt like finding a lifeline. The university's mission to provide tuition-free, high-quality education aligns perfectly with my needs and aspirations.</p>
